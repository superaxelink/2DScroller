/* Here I've been using surface or software rendering with SDL_SURFACE

SDL_Texture on the other hand, is used in a hardware rendering, textures are stored in VRAM and you 
don't have access to it directly as with SDL_Surface. 
The rendering operations are accelerated by GPU, using, internally, 
either OpenGL or DirectX (available only on Windows) API, which in turn are using your video hardware, 
hence hardware rendering name

Hardware rendering is by orders of magnitude faster than software rendering and should be always be 
considered as primary option.
